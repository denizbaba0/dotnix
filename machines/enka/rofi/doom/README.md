This is my doom emacs configuration that I use in daily basis.

# Philosophy

This configuration doesn&rsquo;t carry any heavy lifting for &ldquo;coding&rdquo;
Instead I use emacs for daily task management and note taking.
Also documentation purposes.

Thanks all to org-mode.

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for coding in daily basis ([check my configuration](https://github.com/UTFeight/CamelVim))
